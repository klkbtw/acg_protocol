## üìñ Overview
The Audited Context Generation (ACG) Protocol is designed to prevent AI hallucinations by implementing a dual-layer system. This process connects each fact to a specific source, allowing for verification. The system features two layers: the UGVP layer for source linking and the RSVP layer for auditing logical reasoning. This structured approach ensures that both source information and logical integrity are completely transparent and verifiable.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To begin using the ACG Protocol, follow these simple steps. You will soon be set up and ready to prevent AI errors and improve the reliability of your applications.

### üîç Features
- **Fact Verification:** Each piece of information is linked to a credible source.
- **Logical Auditing:** Review the logical flow when facts are combined.
- **Transparent Reporting:** Easily review both sources and reasoning.
